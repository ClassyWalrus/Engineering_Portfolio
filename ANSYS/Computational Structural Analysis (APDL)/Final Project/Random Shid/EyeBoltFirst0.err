 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      13.781   TIME= 22:43:40
 Structural elements without mid nodes usually produce much more         
 accurate results in quad or brick shape.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      17.375   TIME= 22:44:54
 Mid-nodes of some elements have been modified to lie on straight edges  
 because of distortion with the original mid-nodes.  This condition is   
 sometimes eliminated by tetrahedron element improvement when enabled.   
 Issue ESEL,,STRAIGHTENED to select such elements for listing or         
 plotting.

 Shape testing revealed that 2 of the 24472 new or modified elements     
 violate shape warning limits.  To review test results, please see the   
 output file or issue the CHECK command.

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      34.125   TIME= 23:13:39
 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 out-of-core memory mode.  This memory mode may provide significantly    
 worse performance compared to the in-core memory mode, depending on     
 the amount of available system memory and I/O speed.  Please monitor    
 the solver performance to ensure that the large amount of I/O to the    
 solver files does not create a bottleneck for performance.
