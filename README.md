# Engineering_Portfolio
Welcome to my repository! This is a collection of the CAD designs, code, and simulations I’ve developed throughout my time as an Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics student. The projects contained within this repository showcase a variety of work I have done during my coursework and personal research. They span across several topics including fluid dynamics, structural analysis, propulsion systems, and control systems, among others. Each folder contains the relevant files for each specific project, which may include CAD models, simulation scripts, and other associated documentation.

### Structure of the Repository
* CAD Models: This section includes the 3D models I have designed using SolidWorks. These models represent various components I’ve worked on, such as airframes, propulsion components, and structural systems. They demonstrate my understanding of aerodynamics, structural integrity, and system integration.

* Code: Here you will find all the scripts and algorithms I’ve written, mostly in MATLAB, Python, and C++, for the analysis, simulation, and control of aerospace systems. The code includes simulations for flight dynamics, control systems, aerodynamics, and numerical methods, often paired with theoretical analysis.

* Simulations: This folder contains simulation results and files from different projects. They may be related to finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), or any other simulations I’ve conducted for understanding and testing aerospace system behaviors. I have used tools such as ANSYS, RAS-Aero II, and MATLAB for these simulations.

### Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to showcase the skills I’ve developed over the years, both in the theoretical and practical aspects of aerospace engineering. It also serves as a portfolio of my growth as an engineer, from initial design concepts all the way to simulation and optimization.
